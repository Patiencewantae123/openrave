### Key Changes:
- Added a badge link to the official OpenRAVE homepage.
- Added a **TeamCity** badge for integration with CI tools.
- Included emojis and icons for clarity and engagement.
- Animated GIF or icons can be inserted, but due to Markdown limitations, animated elements would need to be linked to a separate file (e.g., a GIF hosted elsewhere). You could also embed a custom logo with an animation (if available).

Feel free to adjust or further customize it for your project!
